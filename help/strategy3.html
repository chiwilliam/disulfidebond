                        According to the combination rule 3 and considering only two disulfide bond determination
                        methods (for simplicity), the score of a disulfide bond pattern <i>A</i> is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                the summation of the product of the scores of bonding patterns <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, respectively
                                obtained by disulfide bond determination methods <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, when
                                the intersection between <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> equals to <i>A</i> and bonding pattern <i>A</i> is not
                                an empty set.

                                <i>I</i>, which is 1 divided by the summation of the product of the scores of bonding patterns
                                <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, respectively obtained by disulfide bond determination methods
                                <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, when the intersection between <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>
                                is not an empty set.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                1 plus the logarithm (base 10) of <i>I</i>.

                            The formula used to combine disulfide bonds scores according to rule 1 is presented below.
                            This combination formula is commutative and associative; thus, other disulfide bond determination
                            methods (and their scores) can be easily added.
