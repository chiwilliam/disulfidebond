                        This combination strategy allows users to weight the scores obtained by
                        each disulfide bond determination method differently. This strategy is specially powerful when the 
                        bonding patterns found are conflicting or if a particular method is known to perform poorly
                        due to a specific motif <i>(i.e.: poor fragmentation in tandem MS/MS analysis,
                        or when a method is known to perform poorly due to a specific amino acid sequence or bonding
                        arrangement)</i>.
                        <p>
                            While using this strategy, an expert user may assign confidence (reliability) values to the 
                            bonding scores obtained by the different methods used. These confidence values are then 
                            multiplied by their respective bonding pattern score.
                            By default, MS2DB++ assigns maximum confidence (<i>alfa = 1</i>) to all scores.

                            In this strategy, the score of a bonding pattern <i>A</i> is calculated as the average score of 
                            all bonding scores <i>A</i> obtained by the different disulfide bond determination methods, 
                            multiplied by their respective confidence factor <i>alfa</i>. The formula is presented below.
