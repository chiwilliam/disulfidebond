MS2DB++ is an open-source platform-independent web application that efficiently determines the disulfide connectivity in proteins by allowing users to combine a method based on Mass Spectrometry data with methods based on machine learning techniques. The combination of different methods is fully controlled by the user, enhancing the user experience and improving the final results.

MS2DB++ uses the framework available in MS2DB+ to determine S-S bonds using Mass Spectrometry data. While analyzing tandem MS/MS data, the software can account for multiple ions (a, ao, a`*`, b, bo, b`*`, c, x, y, yo, y`*`, and z) in determining the disulfide bonds, yet ensuring that the solution is found in polynomial time. Two other methods based on machine learning techniques to analyze sequence-level information are also available in MS2DB++. The first is based on a SVM-classifier and the second method is based on cysteines separation profiles (CSPs).

Lastly, MS2DB++ allows the user to enter the bonding pattern found by custom methods, which can be combined with the results obtained by the other three methods (MS/MS, SVM, and CSP) to determine a global consistent disulfide connectivity. The methods' combination can be performed using four different rules, also fully controlled by the user. The different combination rules/options aim to improve the quality and accuracy of the results. A through description of each combination rule is presented in the help section.
