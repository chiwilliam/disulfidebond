                        According to the combination rule 1 and considering only two disulfide bond determination
                        methods (for simplicity), the score of a disulfide bond pattern <i>A</i> is:

                                the summation of the product of the scores of bonding patterns <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>, respectively 
                                obtained by disulfide bond determination methods <i>m<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>m<sub>2</sub></i>, when
                                the intersection between <i>B</i> and <i>C</i> equals to <i>A</i> and bonding pattern <i>A</i> is not 
                                an empty set.

                            The formula used to combine disulfide bonds scores according to rule 1 is presented below. 
                            This combination formula is commutative and associative; thus, other disulfide bond determination
                            methods (and their scores) can be easily added.
